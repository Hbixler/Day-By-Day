# Day-By-Day

## Objective
A game that involves putting text messages in order to unravel a story. Each level is portrayed as one day
in a calendar, with each text message thread being counted as a sublevel.

## Current Features Implemented
I have sucessfully developed the following capabilities in this app:

- View controllers to navigate and pass information between levels and sublevels
- A model for each level and sublevel to track progress
- Customized table cells to turn data into displayed text messages
- Randomization and drag-and-drop functions that allow users to "play" the level (aka put the text messages in the correct order)
- Functionality to determine and display if a sublevel has been completed

## Features In Progress
The following are features that are still being developed:

- Using core data to save user progress
- "Locking" certain levels until a user has completed the preceding levels
- Indicating whether a level has been completed on the level selector screen
